	<h1> Why The Beatles Still Rock </h1>
	<p> <img src ="beatle.JPG" alt="Beatles in America"> </p>
	<p> This year marks the 50th anniversary of the
		Beatle's masterpiece Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (which you should listen to now if you haven't already).
		This begs the question, "are the Beatles still the greatest band of all time?" 
		Of course, the answer is a resounding "yes!" Here's why. </p>
	<ol> <li> They've never written a bad song. </li>
		<li> Look at their record sales (even now) </li>
		<li> Critics love them. </li>
		<li> And so do audiences. </li>
		<li> They hold cross-generational appeal. </li>
		<li> Because this list could go on for literally forever . . . </li> </ol>

	<p> Here's a rundown on the band members for those unlucky few who do not know the Beatles. </p>
	<table border= 1>	
	<tr> <th> John Lennon </th> <th> Paul McCartney </th>
		<th> George Harrison </th> <th> Ringo Starr </th> </tr>
	<tr> <th> lead singer, rhythm guitarist, the "Smart One" </th> <th> 
		lead singer, bass guitarist, the "Cute One" </th> <th> lead guitarist, the "Quiet One"
		</th> <th> drummer, the "Funny One" </th> </tr>

	<p> The success of the Beatles can also be measured by the success of its
	individual members after the band's dissolution. All four members of the Beatles
	went on to massive solo success. Today, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, the two
	surviving members of the Beatles, still go on huge world tours. This is proof
	that the Beatles' legacy will live on forever. I'll end with a quote from the Beatles
themselves.
